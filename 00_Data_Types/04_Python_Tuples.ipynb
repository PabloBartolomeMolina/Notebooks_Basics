        "A **tuple** is an immutable, ordered collection of items in Python. It is similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after creation (i.e., they are immutable). This immutability makes tuples useful when you want to ensure that the data remains unchanged.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tuples are defined by placing the items (elements) inside parentheses `()` separated by commas.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about Tuples:\n",
        "- **Ordered**: The items in a tuple have a defined order, and that order will not change.\n",
        "- **Immutable**: Once a tuple is created, the items inside it cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "- **Allows Duplicates**: Since tuples are ordered, they can contain duplicate values.\n",
        "- **Heterogeneous**: A tuple can contain different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats, etc.).\n"
