# Notebooks Basics Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python Notebooks organized by different fundamental topics in Python programming. Each directory focuses on a specific concept, providing a structured learning path to help you enhance your understanding of Python.

## Directory Structure

1. **00_Data_Types**  
   Notebooks covering Pythonâ€™s built-in data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more.

2. **01_Control_Flow**  
   Explore how to manage the flow of execution in Python with conditional statements (`if-else`), loops (`for` and `while`), and exception handling (`try-except`).

3. **02_Functions**  
   Learn how to define and use functions, including arguments, lambda expressions, decorators, and recursion.

4. **03_Object_Oriented_Programming**  
   Notebooks dedicated to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

5. **04_Files_Handling**  
   Manage file operations in Python, including reading, writing, and working with different file formats like CSV and JSON.

6. **05_Modules_and_Packages**  
   Discover how to organize Python code into modules and packages, and how to import and use external libraries.

7. **06_Data_Structures**  
   Dive into more advanced data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

8. **07_Algorithms**  
   Implement common algorithms including sorting (e.g., merge sort, quick sort) and searching techniques (e.g., binary search).

9. **08_Regular_Expressions**  
   Learn how to work with regular expressions to perform complex pattern matching and text manipulation.

10. **09_Testing**  
    Notebooks covering testing methodologies in Python, including unit testing with `unittest` and `pytest`, as well as test-driven development (TDD).

11. **10_Good_Practices**  
    Focus on Python best practices, covering clean code, PEP 8 guidelines, and efficient coding techniques for writing readable and maintainable Python code.

## How to Use

Clone this repository to your local machine and explore the notebooks in any order. The notebooks are self-contained and come with examples and explanations, making them suitable for both beginners and intermediate Python developers.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Each notebook introduces key concepts and provides hands-on examples, allowing you to practice and expand your Python skills.
